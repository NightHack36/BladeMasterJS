## How to Install in Chrome

Install a Chrome extension that will allow custom JS & CSS codefor websites. I recommend this extension but if anyone knows better ones I'm happy to add them to the list:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en

Access this file and view the raw version of the code:
https://github.com/phoenix-tools/BladeMasterJS/blob/master/BladeMasterJS.js

Navigate to CryptoBlades.io

Open the newly installed Chrome Extension's Custom CSS and JS extension and create a new profile

Add the raw code that was copied earlier into the JavaScript panel, and save the profile.

And that's it! The next time you access https://app.cryptoblades.io/#/ the JavaScript code should be loaded and BladeMasterJS operating. 

If you have any trouble installing please reach out in the Discord private room for BladeMasters and I'll help asap.

Happy Forging!
